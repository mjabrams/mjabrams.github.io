<h1>Mitchell J Abrams</h1>
<p>I am a masters student student in Linguistics at Georgetown University, specializing in computational linguistics. I recieved my BA from Binghamton University in Linguistics where I worked in a psycholinguitics lab specializing in spoken word recognition and served as a TA and tutor for ESL students. I am interested in corpus linguistics (developing and annotating corpora), Coptic treebanking, NLP, and forensic linguistics.



<h2>Research</h2>
<p>I've recently been working on developing the first coptic universal dependency treebank, a corpus of Coptic (sahidic dialect) syntactically annotated under the Universal Dependcies framework. I have contributed to developing coptic corpora (<a href="http://copticscriptorium.org/">Coptic Scriptorium</a>) by digitalizing original texts, translating, manually segmenting original texts, contrubtuing to annotation guidelines, and linking entities for NER. 

I am also a part of <a href="http://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/corpling/">CorpLing@Georgetown</a>, Georgetown Universty's computational corpus linguistics lab. Here, we work on devlopeing NLP and annotation tools for corpora.

<h2>Personal</h2>
<p>Growing up in New York City has contrinuted to my passion for lingusitics as I've being surrounded by many languages and speech varieties. Outside of my studies, I'm a competitive runner for <a href="http://www.grcrunning.com/mens-team.html">GRC</a>,  continuing my love for the sport after running NCAA Division 1 Track and Field at <a href="https://bubearcats.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=10822">Binghamton University</a>. </p>



<h2>Linguistic Landscapes</h2>
<p>For fun, I document <a href="https://www.instagram.com/linguistic_landcapes_of_ny/?hl=en">the linguistic landscape of New York City</a>, capturing anything from graffiti to offical government singage</p>
